# OxideDB

[![CI workflow](https://github.com/fcoury/oxide/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fcoury/oxide/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

OxideDB is a personal pet project, inspired by [FerretDB](https://ferretdb.io) and its aim is to close the gap between applications that need MongoDB on top of an existing PostgreSQL deployment and don't want to spend time and effort managing yet another database environment.

This README is a work in progress.

## Quickstart

```bash
$ git clone
$ cd oxide
$ cargo run
```
